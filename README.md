## MMORTS Game

This repo is my version control for a unity game I am working on. It is a MMO isometric base conquering space game. 

Inspiration for this game is from the web browser game Delta Wars / River Combat / Desert Order / 10 other names, and the mobile game Million Lords.

Currently, there are no non-P2W mmorts games in the market, which is why I'm working on this game. 

The game is, from the ground up, entirely based around networking and optimization, and so quality is being prioritized over scope. Currently all the assets are placeholders from free sources, but should this game's code ever be production ready, original assets will be commisioned. 

This is a very large project with a large scope. More than 99% of games that start development never finish. To make sure I make it through, this is a project I will be working on/off over the course of my undergraduate years. 

This is the general work pipeline I'm using: once a certain mechanic works, I will move onto another one. Later, I will revist the mechanic, and often redo it more sophisticatedly for better functionality. This way I'm always improving the game but never staying stuck on a single thing.
